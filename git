   Tags are created to stop further commits.
   Tag are created for the intermediate releases to freeze the code
   Before creating tag, make sure from which branch u are creating tag
   Then checkout that branch(git checkout master) if want to create a tag from master
   then create tag(git tag 10.0.1) if u want to create tag with 10.0.1
   git tag -a 1.0.0 -m "commit message"
   git push origin tag 1.0.0
   
   
   if u want to create first tag and then create branch pushing the command is
   git checkout -b 6.0.0
   git push origin refs/heads/6.0.0:refs/heads/6.0.0

6. How to get the list of remote branches in git
7. How to check who has checkout the code for a specific repo
8. Command to check branches deleted in remote repo and remove the deleted branches
    git remote show originC:\learning\training\5th-June]\june-batch>git remote show origin
* remote origin
  Fetch URL: https://github.com/csenapati12/june-batch.git
  Push  URL: https://github.com/csenapati12/june-batch.git
  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branches:
    MSR-858                     tracked
    develop                     tracked
    master                      tracked
    refs/remotes/origin/MSR-859 stale (use 'git remote prune' to remove)
  Local branch configured for 'git pull':
    master merges with remote master
  Local ref configured for 'git push':
    master pushes to master (up to date)
    
   C:\learning\training\5th-June]\june-batch>git remote prune origin --dry-run
Pruning origin
URL: https://github.com/csenapati12/june-batch.git
 * [would prune] origin/MSR-859
 
 C:\learning\training\5th-June]\june-batch>git remote prune origin
Pruning origin
URL: https://github.com/csenapati12/june-batch.git
 * [pruned] origin/MSR-859
    
    
 9. How to restore the deleted branch
    git reflog
    c9624b6 HEAD@{0}: checkout: moving from master to m1
c9624b6 HEAD@{1}: clone: from https://github.com/csenapati12/june-batch.git


C:\learning\training\5th-June]\june-batch>git checkout -b m22 c9624b6
Switched to a new branch 'm22'

C:\learning\training\5th-June]\june-batch>git push origin m22
