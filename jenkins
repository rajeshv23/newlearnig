1. Build pipeline
2. Jenkins Shared library, DRY(Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself), as organization level the number of pipelines keep on increasing we should not repeate 
    the code or pipeline again and again.To avoid such duplication code or steps its required have the jenkins shared library.
3. parameterized build variables should be CAPITAL letter

  10. Give an example when build will be unstable
       
       command ran from jenkins as: sudo  service httpd status.
       But for the user root/sudo access is not there.
       Hence the build will be UNSTABLE

11. How archiveArtifacts worked?
    Its will save the artifacts outside the workspace(
    $JENKINS_HOME/jobs/<job>/builds/<build>/archive,
    /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/<my-job-name>-build/lastStable/archive/target
    /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/<my-job-name>-build/lastSsuccessful/archive/target) and even though after deleting the workspace(cleanWs()) it will be there with the below path
12. How copyArtifact works?
13. Difference between deleteDir() and cleanWs()?
